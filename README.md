# 🚦 Traffic Signs Detection Using YOLOv8

This project is designed to develop an object detection model using YOLOv8 architecture for identifying and classifying traffic signs. This model can be used in autonomous driving systems for accurate traffic sign recognition.

## 📂 Project Files

- `traffic-signs-detection-using-yolov8.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for training the YOLOv8 model on the traffic signs dataset.
- `LICENSE`: Project license file (MIT License).

## ⚙️ Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Required Libraries:
  - torch
  - ultralytics
  - opencv-python
  - matplotlib
  - numpy

To install the necessary libraries, use the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 📊 Dataset

This project uses a traffic signs dataset for training the model. The dataset includes images and corresponding labels for various traffic signs.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open the `traffic-signs-detection-using-yolov8.ipynb` notebook.
2. Load the dataset.
3. Train the YOLOv8 model.
4. Evaluate the model performance.
